# Internship Search
### Automated Internship Scraper &amp; Email Notifier
This Selenium-based web scraper automatically scans job listing websites for new internship postings, extracts relevant details (such as title, company, location, and application link), and compiles them into a daily email. The scraper runs at 10 AM and 6 PM every day, ensuring I stay updated with the latest opportunities without manually searching.

#### Setup Steps

2) Set the email sender and receiver.
3) Generate a gmail password in your app passwords of your gmail account and add it for the email password.
4) Install selenium and python-dotenv
